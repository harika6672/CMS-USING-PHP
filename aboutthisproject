So Fimally I made some blog using PHP.
For my future reference this document might be helpful.

So basically this web blog is responsive because I have used bootstap framework which will be compatible in both mobile and desktops
So the code required for bootstrap is in a file called bootstap.min.js
jquery plugins are also made availble in this project.

This blog has two views-User and Admin

User can able to see all the posts added by Admin. 
user has a facility to View a particular post, and comment it.Users can able to View the posts of specific categories.

For Example..In this blog..There is a navbar at the top of the page which has various categories like Angular,Bootstap, Jquery..User can
go to only a specific category and View the posts of that category. 

In the Sidebar, there is a login system, if the user has admin credentials then user can see the admin View.

In Admin View..There are different activities being done by Admin..Admin can add posts, View the post..Admin can Add Categories..Delete 
Categories..Admin has the ability to view the comments for the specific posts..Admin will approve or disapprove the comments.
The Comments which are approved by the Admin will only be shown to the users. There is a dashboard which shows a grap indicating the count
of posts,comments,categories etc..


So basically.,Firstly I downloaded xampp..and started apache and mysql using XAMPP Control Panel.We need a Server to run the php code..
because php is run on server side gives output in client side.In C Drive->xampp->htdocs->I created a folder called cms..In browser I 
execute by using url localhost/cms..


In order connect to database..Xampp is providing phpmyAdmin..we can go localhost/phpmyAdmin and create the tables we want..
my table name is cms..which has posts table, categories table, users table and comments table..

Posts Table and Comments Table both are related to each other by category id
Posts and Comments are related to each other by post id..
